This package contains Matlab implementations of the clustering algorithms in "Localized Data Fusion for Kernel k-Means Clustering with Application to Cancer Biology", which is appearing in NIPS 2014.

demo_kernel_kmeans.m file shows how to use the kernel k-means clustering algorithm.
demo_multiple_kernel_kmeans.m file shows how to use the multiple kernel k-means clustering algorithm.
demo_localized_multiple_kernel_kmeans.m file shows how to use the localized multiple kernel k-means clustering algorithm.

clustering methods
------------------
* kkmeans_train.m => training procedure for kernel k-means
* mkkmeans_train.m => training procedure for multiple kernel k-means (requries Mosek optimization software)
* lmkkmeans_train.m => training procedure for localized multiple kernel k-means (requries Mosek optimization software)

If you use any of the algorithms implemented in this package, please cite the following paper:
